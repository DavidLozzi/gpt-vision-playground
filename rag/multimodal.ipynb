If we were to embed the images, we could retrieve images using vectors. My experience, vector searching doesn't suffice for text search, a hybrid approach improves search relevancy. If I were to apply the same assumptions to embedding images, I think we'll still need some level of textual description to help find the most relevant images. Maybe I'm wrong. I won't be exploring multi-modal embeddings and retrieval here. I will in a later post.\n",

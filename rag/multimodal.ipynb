If we were to embed the image, we could retreive images using vectors. My experience, vector searching doesn't suffice for text search, a hybrid approach improves search relevancy. If I was to apply the same assumptions on embedding images, I think we'll still need some level of textual descirption to help find the most relevant images. Maybe I'm wrong. I won't be exploring multi-modal embeddings and retrieval here. I'll cheat the same way I did in the other post.\n",
